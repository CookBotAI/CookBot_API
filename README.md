### Application Description

* CookBot is a full-stack application utilizing OpenAI's API in order to build users recipe cards that they can save to their profiles based on their input. Ideally, the user will provide a list of ingredients of items they already have, and the OpenAI will query the request and return an object that the user can view based on the parameters set in the display modal.
